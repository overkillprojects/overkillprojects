Hey everybody!  Welcome to the github page for @overkillprojects.  If you came here for code and such from my YouTube videos, feel free to browse around.  If you are a client looking for the code for your firmware, you should have received a link to a private respository - if you haven't, please email me!

My name is Walt Jacob, and in my past lives I've been a mathematician and a software developer.  I'm currently a consultant for embedded design and firmware and owner of Overkill Projects.  If you are interested in my (sometimes our) services, please feel free to reach out to me however you like!
